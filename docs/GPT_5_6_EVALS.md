# GPT-5.6 evaluation inventory and Nanocodex run plan

Research snapshot: 2026-07-27. This is preparation for Part 2; it does not
claim that Nanocodex has run these evaluations yet.

## What should enter the first Nanocodex loop

The first useful sweep is not every benchmark in the launch post. It is the
smallest set that exercises Nanocodex's actual agent, VM, tool, and data
boundaries:

1. **Terminal-Bench 2.1** is the immediate end-to-end comparator. The evaluator
   already understands its task/verifier shape, and public GPT-5.6 trajectories
   can diagnose task-level mismatches.
2. **A destructive-workspace suite** should be a completion gate for the normal
   coding-agent boundary. It must score overwrite avoidance and task
   correctness independently and retain the exact pre-existing workspace
   mutation that the agent encountered.
3. **DeepSWE v1.1, SWE-Bench Pro, and SWE-Atlas-QnA** are the next repository
   engineering candidates. Their exact public revisions, harnesses, and
   licenses still need to be pinned before adapters are added.
4. **BrowseComp** is the first browsing candidate after a deterministic browser
   consumer exists. It also exercises multi-agent score/latency frontiers.
5. **Agents' Last Exam** is a later broad professional-workflow target. Its
   public site exposes tasks, traces, a leaderboard, and open code/data
   licensing, but many workflows depend on specialized applications outside
   the current VM slice.

The remaining official evaluations are useful coverage and plot references,
not a reason to expand Part 2 into browser, computer-use, biology, cyber, or
generic multiple-choice infrastructure prematurely.

## Official launch table

The following values transcribe the GPT-5.6 columns from OpenAI's launch table.
They are source anchors, not Nanocodex acceptance thresholds. A reproduced run
must also match the dataset revision, harness, reasoning effort, tool access,
agent topology, time limit, and score policy.

The launch narrative reports 53.6 for Agents' Last Exam while its summary
table reports 52.7%. Until OpenAI publishes the run-level distinction, retain
both source values and do not silently choose one as canonical.

## Safety and agent-integrity evaluations

### Accidental destructive actions

OpenAI describes an internal coding-agent evaluation in which user changes and
data are adversarially injected into a task environment. The model must finish
the requested task without overwriting that protected state. Table 3 reports:

| Model | Avoidance only | Avoidance + correctness |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| GPT-5.5 | 0.88 | 0.44 |
| GPT-5.6 Sol | 0.83 | 0.44 |
| GPT-5.6 Terra | 0.81 | 0.37 |
| GPT-5.6 Luna | 0.73 | 0.32 |

This is a particularly important schema test. One scalar `success` field is
insufficient: a run can preserve user state and fail the task, or pass a task
verifier after destroying protected state. Nanocodex should retain both grader
dimensions, the initial and injected workspace state, the final diff, all
destructive commands attempted, and whether authorization actually covered
each target.

The public system card does not publish the dataset. A Nanocodex analogue must
therefore be clearly labeled as a separate suite rather than presented as a
reproduction of OpenAI's number.

### Other system-card suites to track

The GPT-5.6 system card also discusses these evaluation families:

- challenging disallowed-content prompts, deployment simulation, image-input
  safety, user confirmation during computer use, jailbreak robustness, and
  prompt injection;
- HealthBench, adversarial mental-health simulations, and hallucinations in
  user-flagged cases;
- deployment simulations for misalignment in ChatGPT and internal coding
  traffic;
- chain-of-thought monitorability and controllability, destructive actions,
  confirmation consent, unsupported background-work promises, impossible
  coding tasks, flaky tools, and verbalized metagaming;
- first-person fairness;
- biology and chemistry capability evaluations, including Multimodal
  Troubleshooting Virology, ProtocolQA Open-Ended, TroubleshootingBench, AAV
  capsid packaging, protein binding, and DNA sequence design;
- cyber capability evaluations including CTF, CVE-Bench 1.0, VulnLMP,
  ExploitBench, ExploitGym, SEC-Bench Pro, and external work by Irregular and
  UK AISI;
- self-improvement evaluations including Internal Research Debugging,
  KernelGen 1P, NanoGPT, PostTrainBench Lite, MLE-Bench Revised, and external
  METR work; and
- external alignment, monitorability, and sandbagging evaluations by UK AISI
  and Apollo Research, plus automated and third-party safeguard red teaming.

Most are internal, safety-gated, application-specific, or externally operated.
They belong in the inventory so the result schema does not preclude them; they
are not all Part 2 adapters.

## Public third-party data

### Terminal-Bench 2.1

The detailed comparator, source jobs, task distributions, error-normalization
caveat, token totals, cost, and hardest tasks are recorded in
[`benchmarks/refactor_eval_baseline_2026-07-26.md`](../benchmarks/refactor_eval_baseline_2026-07-26.md#public-gpt-56-sol-terminal-bench-21-comparator).
The submission is provisional and uses fast-agent 0.9.24, not Nanocodex, so it
is diagnostic evidence rather than a score target.

### Artificial Analysis

Artificial Analysis reports its own pre-release measurements:

- Intelligence Index v4.1: Sol 59, Terra 55, Luna 51;
- estimated Intelligence Index cost per task: Sol $1.04, Terra $0.55,
  Luna $0.21;
- Sol averages roughly 15K output tokens per Intelligence Index task;
- Coding Agent Index: Sol 80, Terra 77, Luna 75, spanning DeepSWE,
  Terminal-Bench v2, and SWE-Atlas-QnA;
- AA-Briefcase: Sol's rubric score is 42% and analytical-quality Elo is 1,592;
  it also has the highest presentation Elo reported in that article; and
- the article reports a small AA-Omniscience accuracy uplift accompanied by a
  higher hallucination rate, without publishing those values in the text.

These results are useful plot references because they report cost per task,
output tokens per task, and harness identity alongside quality.

### ARC Prize

ARC Prize publishes verified scores for all 15 combinations of Sol, Terra, and
Luna with low through max reasoning. The max rows are:

| Model | ARC-AGI-1 | ARC-AGI-2 | ARC-AGI-3 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Sol max | 96.5% | 92.5% | 7.78% |
| Terra max | 96.5% | 83.9% | 0.80% |
| Luna max | 88.0% | 59.5% | 0.18% |

Its public result page also gives per-task/per-environment scores and every
reasoning-effort row. That makes it a good future test of parameter-sweep
drilldown even though it is not a VM coding benchmark.

### Agents' Last Exam

Agents' Last Exam reports coverage across 55 sub-industries and more than 1,500
collected tasks, with public task, trace, leaderboard, and repository links.
Its data is CC BY 4.0 and code is Apache-2.0 according to the project site.
Pin the exact evaluated subset before comparing with OpenAI's launch number.

### Partner-reported evaluations in OpenAI's launch post

These are published observations, but most do not expose tasks or raw runs:

- Qodo: higher code-review F1 than GPT-5.5, about 3× fewer tokens per PR, and
  about 2× lower median latency.
- Rogo Big Finance Benchmark: +6.2 rubric-quality points and +3.6 answer-
  accuracy points over GPT-5.5; programmatic tool calling kept quality while
  using 24% fewer output tokens and finishing 28% faster.
- Clio: 14% fewer tokens with higher combined legal-workflow quality;
  programmatic tool calling reduced prompt tokens by 38% without quality loss.
- Balyasny: 1.72× greater token efficiency, leadership in three headline
  categories, and 88% on multi-hop finance tasks.
- Lovable: roughly 25% fewer steps, 35–48% fewer tool calls, and 15% fewer
  stuck runs while improving project success.
- Model ML FinBench: 20 client workflows and hundreds of decks; 39% fewer
  tokens per deck than Claude Fable with qualitative presentation gains.
- Triple Whale: 4.4/5 on a seven-task frontend benchmark versus 4.0 for
  GPT-5.5 and 3.5 for Claude 4.8.
- PlayCo: programmatic tool calling used 63.5% fewer total tokens and 50.1%
  fewer model turns than direct calls at comparable visual quality.
- Base44: 30 app-building conversations, 22% fewer input tokens and 23% fewer
  output tokens than GPT-5.5.
- Legora: improved or held steady on five of seven internal legal tasks.

Keep these as directional product evidence unless a provider publishes its
dataset, grader, harness version, and attempt-level records.

## Required retained data

One immutable attempt record should be sufficient to regenerate every useful
aggregate without rerunning a model. It needs:

- dataset, task, image, verifier, and scoring-policy identifiers and revisions;
- Nanocodex build, model slug, tier, reasoning effort/mode, service tier,
  prompt/instruction/tool configuration, seed, trial, and agent topology;
- VM identity, cold image/bootstrap time, warm startup time, queue wait, and
  isolated guest workspace;
- ordered model, reasoning, tool, and verifier events with raw terminal status;
- input, cache-write, cache-read, output, and reasoning token accounting per
  response and across the complete agent tree;
- price-catalog revision and separate input/cache-write/cache-read/output cost;
- wall time for the root agent plus summed and critical-path model/tool time;
- raw verifier rewards, benchmark-normalized rewards, correctness, safety or
  avoidance dimensions, refusal, timeout, and infrastructure-error classes;
  and
- complete artifacts needed to inspect or replay one failed task.

For multi-agent runs, follow OpenAI's published accounting convention as an
available view: latency comes from the root agent, while token and API-cost
totals include all agents. Also retain per-agent timings so alternative
critical-path and summed-work views remain possible. OpenAI's Ultra results use
four agents by default.

## Plot and drilldown completion gate

The evaluator is ready for tuning loops when the same retained fact table can
produce:

1. score versus estimated cost, latency, and output tokens, with Pareto-frontier
   highlighting;
2. multi-agent score/latency curves by agent count and topology;
3. model/tier/effort/harness comparisons with uncertainty and attempt counts;
4. pass@1, pass@k, per-task `k` distributions, and task-by-task paired deltas;
5. refusal, timeout, verifier failure, safety failure, and infrastructure-error
   breakdowns without silently converting one class into another;
6. cold image/bootstrap, scheduler queue, model, tool, and verifier latency
   decomposition;
7. token and cost composition, including cache reads and writes rather than
   treating all input tokens as one price; and
8. a click-through from every aggregate point to its exact attempts,
   trajectories, tool calls, diffs, verifier output, and artifacts.

The allocation invariant is one retained VM per task across a parameter sweep.
Configurations run concurrently in isolated directories inside that VM; a VM
is not allocated per configuration. Every configuration still receives an
identically seeded private workspace and independent process group.

OpenAI notes that several launch-page latency and cost values are offline
estimates based on production behavior rather than direct wall-clock
measurements. Nanocodex must label measured and simulated values separately and
retain the inputs to either calculation.
